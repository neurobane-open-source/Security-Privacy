# Use socket activation only, to delay the startup of cupsd.
# In practice, on Jessie this means that cupsd is started during
# the initialization of the GNOME session, which is fine: by then,
# the persistent /etc/cups has been mounted.
# XXX: make sure it's the case on Stretch, adjust if not.

# We're starting NetworkManager and Tor ourselves.
# We disable tor.service (as opposed to tor@default.service) because
# it's an important goal to never start Tor before the user has had
# a chance to choose to do so in an obfuscated way: if some other
# package enables tor@whatever.service someday, disabling tor.service
# will disable it as well, while disabling tor@default.service would not.

# systemd-networkd fallbacks to Google's nameservers when no other nameserver
# is provided by the network configuration. In Jessie, this service is disabled
# by default, but it feels safer to make this explicit. Besides, it might be
# that systemd-networkd vs. firewall setup ordering is suboptimal in this respect,
# so let's avoid any risk of DNS leaks here.
